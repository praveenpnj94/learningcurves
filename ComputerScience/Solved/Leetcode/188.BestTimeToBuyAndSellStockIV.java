            // second day and sell on third giving you the maximum
            // profit of (7 - 5) + (5 - 5) = 2. Either way you get
            // same result in case we do not need all 2 transactions to
            // achieve maximum profit. Any unnecessary transactions
            // yield 0 profit, that is why we do not see any error

            // 2nd< transaction even when maximum profit
